- Multiplayer game that allows for real-time game play.

- Create your own multiplayer game with a dedicated server driven by Node.js. 

- Created a server authoritative multiplayer game. 

- Created a dedicated server from the ground up.

- Used Nodejs and worked with WebSockets. 

- I've learned cool stuffs about synchronizing A.I. over the network in real time. By doing this project, I have a multiplayer game template and you can use to make something simple, or something as complex as a massive multiplayer online game or MMO.

- All contributions are welcome.
